# GameOfLife
A hastily put together version of Conway's Game of Life in .NET

There are some commented settings in `Matrix.cs`, so check those out if you want to compile the code yourself! Apart from that, there are some basic controls on screen when the simulation is paused.

Graphics and input are done with the amazing [Raylib-cs](https://github.com/ChrisDill/Raylib-cs).
